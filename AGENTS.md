# Project Overview

Hashdir is a dotnet (f# language) CLI tool to compute the hash or checksum of a directory. This is done recursively using the directories, files and their names within. This is useful for quickly comparing directories and also determining if anything in the filesystem has changed.

It is written in f# language (part of dotnet 8).
